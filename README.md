## Algorithms and Data Structures II Midterm - Postfix++ Interpreter

## Sep 2023 - Jan 2024

## Instructions

1. Run the Interpreter: Execute the script in a Node.js environment or in terminal by typing 'node postfix.js'.

2. Enter Expressions: When prompted, enter a postfix expression or a variable assignment. For example:

- To assign a value: A 5 = (assigns 5 to variable A)
- To perform addition: A 3 + (adds the value of A and 3)

3. Supported Operations: Use the following symbols for operations:

-    =: Assignment
-    +: Addition
-    -: Subtraction
-    *: Multiplication
-    /: Division
-    %: Modulus
-    ^: Exponentiation
-    r: Root
-    l: Logarithm

4. Invalid Input Handling: The interpreter will notify you of any invalid input. Ensure that the number of operands is one more than the number of operators for valid expressions.

5. Continue Entering Expressions: After evaluating an expression, you will be prompted to enter another one.

Note: others code or resources used are referenced.
